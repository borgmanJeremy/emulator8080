# TODO List
- Figure out the best way to strucutre the code to compile with -Wconversion and -Wsign-conversion
- Update unit tests to make sure no functions have side effects
- Update unit tests to have less copy and paste. Maybe put a pointer to each register in a vector and loop through a solution vector.
- Write Curses interface to display register / flag status, stack, and surrounding instructions
x Import hardware test software
- Add much better tests around flags...already found an issue with it
- Refactor instruction init so PC and size are corelated...same with cycle count
- Add unit tests to check cycle count
